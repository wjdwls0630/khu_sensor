This is the README file:

I. Contents of Directory: There are 13 files and 1 directory in this 
                          directory.
 
  1. README: This file

  2. detect_longnet.scr: dc_shell script file. 
     It detects nets whose interconnect delay is larger than 2 nano seconds.

  3. set_machine.scr: dc_shell script file. 
     detect_longnet.scr calls set_machine.scr to get machine/OS information 
     such as 'sunOS'.

  4. new_delay.scr: dc_shell script file. 
     It annotates user-defined interconnect delay to the nets which were 
     detected by detect_longnet.scr.

  5. cut_net.awk: awk file. 
     It is called by detect_longnet.scr.

  6. long_delay.awk: awk file. 
     It is called by detect_longnet.scr.

  7. adjust_net_delay.csh: C shell file. 
     It is called by detect_longnet.scr.

  8. detect_longnet.man: user's manual for detect_longnet.scr and 
     new_delay.scr.

  9. to_DC_sdf: C shell script file.
     It modifies SDF file which generated by CubicDelay. (In case that the 
     design includes asynchronous memory) 

 10. translate_sdf.man: user's manual to translate SDF file generated by 
     CubicDelay.
    
 11. nand_tree_dont_touch.dc: dc_shell script file.
     It sets dont_touch attribute on port of nand tree.

 12. del_cap_res.scr: dc_shell script file.
     It remove load and resistance of port's net.

 13. del_cap_res.pt.scr: pt_shell script file.
     It remove load and resistance of port's net.

 14. links-to-layout: some useful script files help you to use LTL flow.



II. Please read the following notes.

Note1> You may use detect_longnet.scr and new_delay.scr after synthesis.
      Other script and awk files in this directory are called 
      by detect_longnet.scr and new_delay.scr automatically.

      Please follow the steps below:

          Step1: After synthesis, run detect_longnet.scr to detect the nets 
                 whose interconnect delay is larger than 2 nano seconds. 
                 This will generate a file called "long_delays".

          Step2: Edit long_delays file to change interconnect delay information. 
          Step3: Run new_delay.scr.

      * For more information, please refer to "detect_longnet.man" 
        in this directory.

Note2> You may use to_DC_sdf before back-annotation.
      
      dc_shell> sh to_DC_sdf target_sdf_file

      * For more information, please refer to "translate_sdf.man" 
        in this directory.
