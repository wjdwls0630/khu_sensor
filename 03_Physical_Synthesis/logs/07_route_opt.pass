# To fix antenna violations
# This "diode_cell_hd" cell must be manually inserted during P&R
# The cell is an diode on the net close to input gates, which do not meet the antenna effect.
# Actually, the library specifies a maximum wire length for antenna rule.
# However, the route may connect longer wires to the input gates of cells than maximum wire length.
# If this is the case, the "diode_cell_hd" cells are added to meet the antenna rule.
# Antenna cell connects to a diode, reverse biased to ground.
