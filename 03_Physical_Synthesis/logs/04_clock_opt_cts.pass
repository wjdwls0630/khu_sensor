####### Define scenarios
## This is example, modify this according to your scenarios.
##
## Generally, FP_SCN, PLACE_OPT_SNC and ROUTE_SCN uses worst function mode scenario such as func1_wstti.
## CLOCK_OPT_CTS_SCN uses all cts scenario such as funccts_wstti,scantcts_wstti,bistcts_wstti,jtagcts_wstti.
## CLOCK_OPT_PSYN_SCN, ROUTE_OPT_SCN and CHIP_FINISH_SCN uses all scenarios except for CLOCK_OPT_CTS_SCN.
## HOLD_ONLY_SCN optimizes only hold time and mttv.
## So, you uses best corner scenarios such as func1_bst,scan1_bst,bist1_bst and jtag_bst.

# 3. Verify Congestion value. Congestion value must be lower than 4.
# 4. After placement, the ideal situaltion is that there is no timing violation.
