####### Define scenarios
## This is example, modify this according to your scenarios.
##
## Generally, FP_SCN, PLACE_OPT_SNC and ROUTE_SCN uses worst function mode scenario such as func1_wstti.
## CLOCK_OPT_CTS_SCN uses all cts scenario such as funccts_wstti,scantcts_wstti,bistcts_wstti,jtagcts_wstti.
## CLOCK_OPT_PSYN_SCN, ROUTE_OPT_SCN and CHIP_FINISH_SCN uses all scenarios except for CLOCK_OPT_CTS_SCN.
## HOLD_ONLY_SCN optimizes only hold time and mttv.
## So, you uses best corner scenarios such as func1_bst,scan1_bst,bist1_bst and jtag_bst.

# additional power net robustness
#******************************************************************************
# Note Voltage noise induced by inductance
#
# In Reality, current flows in loops. In this case, we only deal in terms of power,
# not fast-switching signal, such as clock. We use wide, thick, upper-level metal
# because of preventing IC Chip from IR-Drop. (The  wider and thicker metal, the less resistance)
# In addition, in order to minimize the effect of IR-Drop, Designers frequently
# draw power lines by shape of mesh. However, this shape make a plethora of loops which yield
# producing or changing magnetic fields.
# (If there is return path of currents, metals have inductance)
# Changing magnetic fields in turn current in other loops(mutual inductive coupling).
# Inductance take a toll on delay and power. (Even if resistance is 0,
# delay(edge rates) would not 0 since resonant factor(LC) is existed.)
# In power case, when turning on chips voltage will switch simultaneously and flow substantial
# currents.(A role of Power PAD is also impact on it since most of PADs tend to charge quickly)
# By following the formula of V_drop = L*di/dt, Simultaneously Switching leads to Voltage change
# which is often called 'Ground Bounce' or 'Inductive voltage noise'. Granted, most of PADs have
# preventing these phenomenons but we should care about it.
#
# Return to our design, we placed mesh power straps for the sake of effective supplying voltage.
# Moreover, given aforementioned risk, we placed straps at moderate intervals.
# (The effect of mutual inductive coupling is greatly increasing especially when the return path
# is far from conductor.)
